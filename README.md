# Voxbridge

**Route Android phone call audio to AI in real-time.**

Voxbridge captures cellular call audio from a rooted Android device and streams it bidirectionally to an AI backend (OpenAI Realtime, etc.), enabling AI-powered phone conversations over real phone numbers.

> ⚠️ **Early Development** — This project is exploring uncharted territory. Contributions and findings welcome.

## Why?

Existing AI voice solutions require:
- SIP/VoIP infrastructure
- Porting your phone number
- Dedicated hardware

Voxbridge takes a different approach: use the phone you already have. Your AI assistant makes and receives calls using your actual cellular connection.

## How It Works

                    WebSocket API
                    (control/monitor)
```

1. **Audio Capture**: Hooks into Android's audio subsystem to capture call audio (uplink + downlink)
2. **Format Conversion**: Resamples telephony audio (8-16kHz) to AI-expected format (24kHz)
3. **Bidirectional Streaming**: Sends caller audio to AI, plays AI responses back into the call
4. **Control API**: WebSocket interface for initiating calls, monitoring state, injecting audio

## Requirements

- **Rooted Android phone** (Magisk recommended)
- **SELinux permissive** or appropriate policies
- **USB debugging** or Termux SSH access
- Tested on: Pixel 7 Pro (Tensor G2) — other devices may need adaptation

## Project Status

### Phase 1: Discovery (Current)
- [ ] Map PCM devices for call audio on Pixel 7 Pro
- [ ] Identify required mixer controls
- [ ] Verify audio capture during active call
- [ ] Document sample rates and formats

### Phase 2: Proof of Concept
- [ ] Capture call audio to file
- [ ] Play audio file into active call
- [ ] Basic streaming to external endpoint

### Phase 3: AI Integration
- [ ] OpenAI Realtime API integration
- [ ] Real-time bidirectional streaming
- [ ] Latency optimization

### Phase 4: Productization
- [ ] Android app with background service
- [ ] WebSocket control API
- [ ] Documentation for other devices

## Quick Start

*Coming soon — we're still in the discovery phase.*

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voxbridge.git
cd voxbridge

# Run diagnostics on your connected Android device
./scripts/diagnose.sh
```

## Research Notes

### Known Challenges

1. **Mixer Controls**: Android audio routing requires specific ALSA mixer settings that vary by device
2. **Audio Format**: Telephony uses 8-16kHz; AI APIs expect 24kHz — resampling needed
3. **Separate Streams**: Uplink (your mic) and downlink (caller) may be on different PCM devices
4. **HAL Contention**: Android's Audio HAL may lock devices during calls

### Alternative Approaches Considered

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Raw PCM capture | Direct, low latency | Device-specific, needs root |
| AudioRecord API | Standard Android API | May not expose call audio |
| Bluetooth HFP | Standard protocol | Added latency, complexity |
| SIP/VoIP | Battle-tested | Requires number porting |

We chose raw PCM capture for lowest latency and maximum control, accepting the device-specific complexity.

## Contributing

This is uncharted territory. If you have:
- A rooted Android device and want to help test
- Knowledge of Android audio internals
- Experience with real-time audio streaming

Please open an issue or PR! Device-specific findings are especially valuable.
